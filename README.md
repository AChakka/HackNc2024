## Adding MongoDB Atlas
For our StarDaze Project, we aimed to create a MongoDB Atlas database to store our user information, and help with authentication. We used MongoDB and Express to create a backend API that our React front end could interact with. We managed to fully implement our backend api. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to integrate it into our current project. We plan on adding this functionality in the future, so that we can scale our project to have multiple users with personalized information that can be stored in our database.
